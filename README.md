## What is Blockprint?

Blockprint is a community hub for Minecraft builds. It turns submissions from creators into clean, easy-to-browse pages with:

- A live 3D preview you can orbit and inspect
- A clear materials list extracted from the build’s structure file
- Credits and social links so you can find and support the creator
- A downloadable pack (when provided) so you can try the build yourself

## What you can do

- Explore builds on the Discover page and open any model for full details
- Share models with friends — links show rich previews on social apps
- Sign in with Discord to submit your own creations
- Manage your own submissions from your Profile (you can remove them before they’re approved)

## For creators

- Submitting is simple: add a name and short description, choose categories, and upload your files
- Materials are auto-detected from the structure file to help players gather resources
- Your creator name and socials appear on your build page so players can follow your work

## Curation and publishing

- Submissions are reviewed before going live to keep the gallery high‑quality
- Approved items first appear as Drafts, where a preview image can be generated and a download pack can be attached
- Once everything looks good, the build is published to Discover

## Respect and safety

- Please only submit creations you made or have permission to share
- Keep descriptions and links appropriate for all audiences
- If you spot an issue with a build or a broken link, report it and we’ll take a look

## Questions

- Why can’t I submit? You’ll need to sign in with Discord first
- Why don’t I see the Admin page? Only trusted reviewers have access
- My link doesn’t show an image on Discord/Twitter: published models include a preview image; try sharing again after a few minutes
